Overview:
The get_wire_advice_details_http method is responsible for processing wire advice details for pending transactions. It retrieves pending transaction exceptions from the database, categorizes them based on their feed type (PD or CD), creates reference number dictionaries for CD transactions, processes pending references for both PD and CD transactions, and updates the relevant tables with the wire advice details.
Step-by-Step Logic:
	1.	Initialization:
			The method initializes a logger, which is used for logging messages throughout the process.
	2.	Retrieve Pending Transactions:
			Fetches pending transaction exceptions from the transaction_exception table using TransactionExceptionsDao.
			Filters the records based on the is_processed and transaction_type criteria.
	3.	Process CD Transactions:
			If there are pending CD transactions, their IDs are appended to the cd_pending_tran_ids list.
			Calls CdTransactionInfoDao.create_reference_number_dict to create reference number dictionaries for CD transactions.
			Loops through the cd_pending_tran_ids list to fetch records from the cd_transaction_info table and populate the dictionaries.
	4.	Process Pending References:
			The method process_pending_references is called with the created dictionaries for further processing.
			Outer loop iterates over transaction dates, while the inner loop iterates over reference numbers for each date.
			Splits the reference number into bank reference and account number and retrieves the tran_id.
			Sends a request to retrieve wire advice details from the wire service using request_sender.get_wire_advice_details_from_wirecore.
			If a valid response is received, the wire advice details are mapped and inserted into the WireAdviceDetails table.
			Depending on the feed_type, corresponding tables (CD_Transaction_Info or PD_Transaction_Info) are updated with the reference ID.
			Updates the transaction_exception table for processed transactions with the wire response status.
			If the wire response is None, it updates the TransactionException table with an error status.
	5.	Similar Process for PD Transactions:
The same process applies to PD transactions, but with different tables (PD_Transaction_Info instead of CD_Transaction_Info).








Overview:- 
It begins by checking the status of the current process step and then proceeds to handle exceptions and process actions. If the current step is runnable, it calls a function to await wire exceptions, which returns a response status code. After handling exceptions, it invokes a function to handle process actions based on the process status. This function prepares a request body with details such as business date, step, status, and trigger source. Depending on the process status, it either creates a new request or updates an existing one in the PD BAI Process Log. While a certain condition is true, it calls another function to check for pending wire transactions. If there are none, the loop continues; otherwise, it marks the process status as FAILED and stops the loop. Finally, based on the response status code, the main function sends either a success or a critical response message.

Detailed Documentation
Main Function
The main function starts by checking the status of the current process step using the process_log_utility.check_process_status() function. This function compares the current step with the previous steps and returns True if the current step is runnable, and False otherwise.
Process Exception Handler
If the current step is runnable, the await_process_wire_exception() function is called. This function takes four parameters: a logger, a process log utility, the name of the Azure function, and the current step. It returns a response status code.

Handle Process Action
After handling the process exception, the process_log_utility.handle_process_action() function is called. This function performs various actions based on the process status. It prepares a request body (req_body) with details such as business date, step, status, and trigger source. Depending on the process status, it either creates a new request or updates an existing one.

Determine Process Status
The process_status is determined based on the current step and the previous steps. If the current step is runnable, the process_status is set to RUNNING. If the current step fails, the process_status is set to FAILED.

Process Create Request
If the process_status is RUNNING, the process_create_request() function is called. This function validates the process status and prepares a dictionary to insert into the table. The dictionary is then loaded into a PDBaiProcessLogSchema object and inserted into the PD BAI Process Log.

Process Update Request
If the process_status is either COMPLETED or FAILED, the process_update_request() function is called. This function retrieves the process log record and updates it with the new request body.

Get Wire Advice Details
While the process_action_bool is True, the get_wire_advice_details() function is called to check for any pending wire transactions. If there are no pending transactions (i.e., the status code is 200), the loop continues. Otherwise, the process status is marked as FAILED and the loop stops.

Send Response
Finally, in the main function, if the response_status_code is 200, a success message is sent. Otherwise, a critical response is sent.
